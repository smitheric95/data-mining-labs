## Project 1
[In this paper](Project1/Project%201%20Report.pdf), we analyze the relationships between various medical claim attributes in order to better understand what sort of health predictors can lead a person to hospital admission. The prediction of a person’s number of days spent in a hospital the following year could be a valuable metric, especially for insurance companies that will be paying for these hospital visits.

We conclude that attributes like age, number of medical conditions, and number of claims are good indicators of whether or not people will be admitted into the hospital the following year. Furthermore, we show that severity of sickness (Charlson index) and the number of visits a patient makes to internal specialists, can help us predict how long patients will stay in the hospital.
